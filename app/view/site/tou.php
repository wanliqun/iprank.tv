				<h1><a name="dcma-notice">15. DMCA Notice</a></h1>
				<p>iPrank.TV respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of copyrights and all other intellectual property very seriously, and we ask our users to do the same. Infringing activity will not be tolerated on or through the Site.</p>
				<p>(A). iPrank.TV’s intellectual property policy is to:</p>
				<p>(i). remove material that iPrank.TV believes in good faith, upon notice from an intellectual property owner or their agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the Site.</p>
				<p>(ii). remove any End User content posted to the Site by “repeat infringers.”&nbsp;iPrank.TV considers a “repeat infringer” to be any user that has uploaded End user content to the Site and for whom iPrank.TV has received more than two takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 512.</p>
				<p>(iii). with respect to such End User content. iPrank.TV has discretion, however, to terminate the account of any user after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon iPrank.TV's own determination.</p>
				<p>(B). iPrank.TV’s designated agent for notices of claimed infringement can be contacted at: <a href="mailto:contact@iPrank.tv">contact@iPrank.tv</a></p>
				<p>(C). If End User is a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any user content, or other content, infringes upon End User's copyrights, End User may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, as amended (the "DMCA") by providing us with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail): </p>
				<p>(i) the physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</p>
				<p>(ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site; </p>
				<p>(iii) identification of the user content, or other content, that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;</p>
				<p>(iv) information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact End User, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address; </p>
				<p>(v) a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the user content, or other content, in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; </p>
				<p>(vi) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that End User is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>
				<p>(D). If End User believes that End User's user content, or other content, that has been removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that End User has authorization from the actual copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to law, to submit, post and make use of such User Content, or other content, End User may send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Agent: </p>
				<p>(i) end User's physical or electronic signature;</p>
				<p>(ii) identification of the user content, or other content, that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the user content, or other content appeared on the Site prior to the point at which such user content, or other content, was removed or disabled;</p>
				<p>(iii) a statement that End User has a good faith belief that the user content, or other content, was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the user content, or other content; </p>
				<p>(iv) End User's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address, a statement that End User consents to the jurisdiction of the federal court in state of California, and a statement that End User will accept service of process from the party that provided notification of the alleged infringement.</p>
